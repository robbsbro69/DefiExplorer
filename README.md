# 🧭 DeFi Explorer - DApp Directory

**DeFi Explorer** is a minimalistic, chain-agnostic web-based directory for exploring Decentralized Applications (DApps) across multiple blockchain networks. It allows users to browse and access DEXs, Lending Protocols, and NFT Marketplaces on popular chains like Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Manta, Ink, Swell, Cyber)
- 🧭 Categorized browsing:  
  - **DEXs** (Decentralized Exchanges)  
  - **Lending Protocols**  
  - **NFT Marketplaces**
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight interface with smooth UX
- 🔗 One-click redirection to live DApps
- 🌙 Elegant responsive UI, mobile-friendly



## 🧠 How It Works

- Select your preferred blockchain from the dropdown.
- The page dynamically displays DApps from that chain sorted into DEXs, Lending, and NFT categories.
- Clicking a DApp redirects you to its official app site.
- Each DApp shows a mini "logo", description, and visit button.


## 📌 To-Do / Future Features

- 🔍 DApp search functionality
- 📈 Add on-chain metrics or TVL
- ⚙️ User preference persistence (localStorage)
- 💬 User reviews / ratings (maybe Web3 based?)

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs are welcome! If you have suggestions for DApps or want to add more chains, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request.
